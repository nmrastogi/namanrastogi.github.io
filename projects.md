<span style="color:red">Current Project: </span> **QAnon** (2024-present) 
<br>This project examines the impact of platform migration on the QAnon community during their transition from Twitter to alterna- tive platforms like Parler and Dotwin following initial widespread account bans on Twitter. We examine how QAnon’s community dynamics—including user roles and activities—evolved amidst this migration by analyzing their activities on Twitter, Parler, and Dotwin in the months leading up to the Jan 6th Capitol attack. We assess user engagement and influence changes, categorizing users into five distinct roles: ’common users,’ ‘broadcasters,’ ’influentials,’ ’hidden influentials,’ and ’lurkers.’ Conducted temporal analyses of weekly fluctuations in user activity, revealing significant trends and patterns in QAnon engagement across mainstream and alternative platforms.
Introduced lexical analysis to examine the nature of conversations, categorizing content into themes such as violence and conspiracy to uncover underlying narratives within the QAnon community.

The findings of this project were selected for a poster presentation at ACM [GROUP 2025](https://group.acm.org/conferences/group25/index.php)[[PDF]](https://osf.io/xeau9/), and a full paper was submitted to ACM [CSCW 2025](https://cscw.acm.org/2025/)[[PDF]](https://osf.io/exh2k), which is under review.

**The DIY approach in T1 diabetes** (2023)
<br> In this project, we aimed to develop a deep insight into how the type-1 diabetic(T1D) community works to solve their issues without institutional experts. This led to our research question: “How do the type-1 diabetic community create their own knowledge and solve their own issues.”

**Assessing the Influence of the Covid 19 Pandemic on Indian Pharmaceutical Companies** (2022)
<br>Our objective is to study, analyze and draw inferences on the movement of the stock prices of Indian pharmaceutical companies solely based on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. We specifically targeted pharmaceutical stocks because their share price is more directly dependent on the COVID-19 pandemic than companies in other sectors. As the demand for the primary products sold by pharmaceutical companies, i.e., medicines, is directly dependent on the COVID-19 pandemic, a common hypothesis is that the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies at a given time are significantly contingent upon the COVID-19 pandemic situation. We have tested this hypothesis by calculating the correlation between pharmaceutical stock prices and COVID-19 variables that measure the severity and provide an outline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, as human emotion plays a significant part in deciding the share prices, we have considered public fear and awareness by considering the frequency by which the terms “Covid 19” and “Covid medicines” are searched on Google. The data we have considered for our study belongs to the period from 15th March 2020 to 17th February 2022.
