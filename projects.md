**Current Project: QAnon**(2024-present)
<br>This project examines the impact of platform migration on the QAnon community during their transition from Twitter to alterna- tive platforms like Parler and Dotwin following initial widespread account bans on Twitter. We examine how QAnon’s community dynamics—including user roles and activities—evolved amidst this migration by analyzing their activities on Twitter, Parler, and Dotwin in the months leading up to the Jan 6th Capitol attack. We assess user engagement and influence changes, categorizing users into five distinct roles: ’common users,’ ‘broadcasters,’ ’influentials,’ ’hidden influentials,’ and ’lurkers.’ Conducted temporal analyses of weekly fluctuations in user activity, revealing significant trends and patterns in QAnon engagement across mainstream and alternative platforms.
Introduced lexical analysis to examine the nature of conversations, categorizing content into themes such as violence and conspiracy to uncover underlying narratives within the QAnon community.
