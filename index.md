**Hello There!**

My name is Naman Rastogi, and I am a Master's student pursuing Computer science at the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), University of Utah. I am advised by [Dr. Marina Kogan](http://www.mkoganresearch.com/). 

My research interests are **Social Computing** and **Human-centered computing**. Specifically, I like using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques on social media data.
